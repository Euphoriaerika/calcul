# JavaScript Calculator

This is my outdated implementation of a calculator that uses eval for calculations. It is not recommended to use it due to its potential security threats. The main focus of this project is on visual styling.

## Functionality

This calculator supports the following operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, trigonometric functions, and algebraic functions. Buttons "T" and "A" are created for switching between them.

You can also switch between light and dark themes, changing the color palette of the site. To apply your color palette, simply modify the values in the :root and .dark-theme selectors.

The site has a simple animation in the form of a circle that appears on launch.
