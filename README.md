# JavaScript Calculator

This is an updated version of my calculator implementation, now utilizing reverse Polish notation for expression evaluation instead of eval(). This change enhances security by eliminating potential vulnerabilities associated with using eval().

## Functionality

This calculator supports the following operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, trigonometric functions, and algebraic functions. Buttons "T" and "A" are created for switching between them.

You can also switch between light and dark themes, changing the color palette of the site. To apply your color palette, simply modify the values in the :root and .dark-theme selectors.

The site has a simple animation in the form of a circle that appears on launch.
